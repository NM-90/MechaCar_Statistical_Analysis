## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Determine teh p-value and the r-squared value for linear regression model.

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The vehicle length, ground clearance, and AED would have non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.  Those values will not vary, and thus have zero variance. 

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?  Why or why not?

The p-value and linear model prediction?
 

Does the linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?  Why or why not?

The r-squared value is 71% so this would suggest that the mpg predictions will be predicted effectively.
