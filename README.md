## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Determine teh p-value and the r-squared value for linear regression model.

 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

    The vehicle length, ground clearance, and AWD would have non-random amount of variance to the mpg values.  Those values will not vary, and thus have zero variance. 

 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?  Why or why not?

    The p-value and linear model prediction...?
 
 3. Does the linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?  Why or why not?

    The r-squared value is 71% so this would suggest that the mpg prototypes will be predicted effectively.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

  Cars from Lot 3 do not meet the suspension coil specifications because the variance= 170, exceeding the 100 pounds per square inch.
